*PyLasm* is meant to be a Python interface to Lanczos Algorithm for the exact diagonalization of generalized Spin Models. In particular, it allows to estimate the first few low-energy eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the associated spin Hamiltonian matrix with a remarkable precision. Hence the ground-state eigenstates are used to compute the spin-spin correlation functions and the magnetization strength.
